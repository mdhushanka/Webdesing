            The first “cheese cake” may have been created on the Greek island of
            Samos. Physical anthropologists excavated cheese molds there which
            were dated circa 2,000 B.C. Cheese and cheese products had most
            likely been around for thousands of years before this, but earlier
            than this goes into prehistory (that period in human history before
            the invention of writing) so we will never really know. In Greece,
            cheesecake was considered to be a good source of energy, and there
            is evidence that it was served to athletes during the first Olympic
            games in 776 B.C. Greek brides and grooms were also known to use
            cheesecake as a wedding cake. The simple ingredients of flour,
            wheat, honey and cheese were formed into a cake and baked – a far
            cry from the more complicated recipes available today!

        1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease and line a springform pan with
        parchment paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. In a large bowl, mix cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract until
        smooth.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Pour the
        batter into the prepared crust.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Bake in the preheated oven until the center is set, about 1 hour and
        30 minutes.
      </p>

        5. Allow the cheesecake to cool in the pan, then refrigerate for at
        least 4 hours before serving.
